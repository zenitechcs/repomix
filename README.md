📦 Repomix is a powerful tool that packs your entire repository into a single, AI-friendly file.  
It is perfect for when you need to feed your codebase to Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI tools like Claude,
ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Gemini, Gemma, Llama, Grok, and more.

## 🎉 New: Repomix Website & Discord Community!

- Try Repomix in your browser at [repomix.com](https://repomix.com/)
- Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wNYzTwZFku) for support and discussion

**We look forward to seeing you there!**

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Optimized**: Formats your codebase in a way that's easy for AI to understand and process.
- **Token Counting**: Provides token counts for each file and the entire repository, useful for LLM context limits.
- **Simple to Use**: You need just one command to pack your entire repository.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure what to include or exclude.
- **Git-Aware**: Automatically respects your `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude`.
- **Security-Focused**: Incorporates [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) for robust security checks to detect and prevent inclusion of sensitive information.
- **Code Compression**: The `--compress` option uses [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to extract key code elements, reducing token count while preserving structure.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the CLI Tool `>_`

You can try Repomix instantly in your project directory without installation:

```bash
npx repomix
```

Or install globally for repeated use:

```bash
# Install using npm
npm install -g repomix

# Alternatively using yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Alternatively using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Then run in any project directory
repomix
```

That's it! Repomix will generate a `repomix-output.xml` file in your current directory, containing your entire
repository in an AI-friendly format.

You can then send this file to an AI assistant with a prompt like:

```
This file contains all the files in the repository combined into one.
I want to refactor the code, so please review it first.
```

![Repomix File Usage 1](website/client/src/public/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-1.png)

When you propose specific changes, the AI might be able to generate code accordingly. With features like Claude's
Artifacts, you could potentially output multiple files, allowing for the generation of multiple interdependent pieces of
code.

### Output File Format

Repomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase.  
To enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to
understand the context and structure of the packed repository.

#### XML Format (default)

The XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

```xml
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

<file_summary>
  (Metadata and usage AI instructions)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/
cli/
cliOutput.ts
index.ts

(...remaining directories)
</directory_structure>

<files>
<file path="src/index.js">
  // File contents here
</file>

(...remaining files)
</files>

<instruction>
(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
</instruction>
```

For those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:  
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags

> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a
> game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

This means that the XML output from Repomix is not just a different format, but potentially a more effective way to feed
your codebase into AI systems for analysis, code review, or other tasks.

#### Markdown Format

To generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

The Markdown format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

````markdown
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

# File Summary

(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

# Repository Structure

```
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
```

(...remaining directories)

# Repository Files

## File: src/index.js

```
// File contents here
```

(...remaining files)

# Instruction

(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
````

This format provides a clean, readable structure that is both human-friendly and easily parseable by AI systems.

#### Plain Text Format

To generate output in plain text format, use the `--style plain` option:

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

```text
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================
(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

================================================================

```

### Updating Repomix

To update a globally installed Repomix:

```bash
# Using npm
npm update -g repomix

# Using yarn
yarn global upgrade repomix
```

Using `npx repomix` is generally more convenient as it always uses the latest version.

### Remote Repository Processing

Repomix supports processing remote Git repositories without the need for manual cloning. This feature allows you to
quickly analyze any public Git repository with a single command.

To process a remote repository, use the `--remote` option followed by the repository URL:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

You can also use GitHub's shorthand format:

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix
```

You can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:

```bash
# Using --remote-branch option
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main

# Using branch's URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main
```

Or use a specific commit hash:

```bash
# Using --remote-branch option
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695

# Using commit's URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1
```

### Code Compression

The `--compress` option utilizes [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to perform intelligent code extraction, focusing on essential function and class signatures while removing implementation details. This can help reduce token count while retaining important structural information.

```bash
repomix --compress
```

For example, this code:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Will be compressed to:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature that we'll be actively improving based on user feedback and real-world usage

### MCP Server Integration

Repomix supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), allowing AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase. When run as an MCP server, Repomix provides tools that enable AI assistants to package local or remote repositories for analysis without requiring manual file preparation.

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

#### Configuring MCP Servers

To use Repomix as an MCP server with AI assistants like Claude, you need to configure the MCP settings:

**For VS Code:**

You can install the Repomix MCP server in VS Code using one of these methods:

1. **Using the Install Badge:**

See [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) for encoding details. | `"o200k_base"`         |

The configuration file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax, which allows:
- Comments (both single-line and multi-line)
- Trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Unquoted property names
- More relaxed string syntax

Example configuration:

```json5
{
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": true,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Custom header information for the packed file.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "copyToClipboard": true,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100
    }
  },
  "include": [
    "**/*"
  ],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Patterns can also be specified in .repomixignore
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  },
}
```

### Global Configuration

To create a global configuration file:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

The global configuration file will be created in:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json`
- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repomix/repomix.config.json` or `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`

Note: Local configuration (if present) takes precedence over global configuration.

### Include and Ignore

#### Include Patterns

Repomix now supports specifying files to include
using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more
flexible and powerful file selection:

- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory
- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories
- Combine multiple patterns like `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown
  files

#### Ignore Patterns

Repomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing
process:

- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude` are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting or the `--no-gitignore` cli option.
- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules,
  .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting or the `--no-default-patterns` cli option. Please
  see [defaultIgnore.ts](src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.
- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore
  patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.
- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the
  configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.

Priority Order (from highest to lowest):

1. Custom patterns `ignore.customPatterns`
2. `.repomixignore`
3. `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude` (if `ignore.useGitignore` is true and `--no-gitignore` is not used)
4. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true and `--no-default-patterns` is not used)

This approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size
of the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while
preventing the leakage of confidential information.

Note: Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the "Repository
Structure" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the
packed file efficient and text-based.

### Custom Instruction

The `output.instructionFilePath` option allows you to specify a separate file containing detailed instructions or
context about your project. This allows AI systems to understand the specific context and requirements of your project,
potentially leading to more relevant and tailored analysis or suggestions.

Here's an example of how you might use this feature:

1. Create a file named `repomix-instruction.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Coding Guidelines

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate
- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English
- All new features should have corresponding unit tests

# Generate Comprehensive Output

- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise
- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality
```

2. In your `repomix.config.json`, add the `instructionFilePath` option:

```json5
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

When Repomix generates the output, it will include the contents of `repomix-instruction.md` in a dedicated section.

Note: The instruction content is appended at the end of the output file. This placement can be particularly effective
for AI systems. For those interested in understanding why this might be beneficial, Anthropic provides some insights in
their documentation:  
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips

> Put long-form data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above
> your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.
> Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.

### Comment Removal

When `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, Repomix will attempt to remove comments from supported file types. This
feature can help reduce the size of the output file and focus on the essential code content.

Supported languages include:  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Shell,
and YAML.

Note: The comment removal process is conservative to avoid accidentally removing code. In complex cases, some comments
might be retained.

## 🔍 Security Check

Repomix includes a security check feature that uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect
potentially sensitive information in your files. This feature helps you identify possible security risks before sharing
your packed repository.

The security check results will be displayed in the CLI output after the packing process is complete. If any suspicious
files are detected, you'll see a list of these files along with a warning message.

Example output:

```
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected:
1. src/utils/test.txt
2. tests/utils/secretLintUtils.test.ts

Please review these files for potentially sensitive information.
```

By default, Repomix's security check feature is enabled. You can disable it by setting `security.enableSecurityCheck` to
`false` in your configuration file:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

Or using the `--no-security-check` command line option:

```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling security checks may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary, such
> as when working with test files or documentation that contains example credentials.

## 📚 Using Repomix as a Library

In addition to using Repomix as a CLI tool, you can also use it as a library in your Node.js applications.

### Installation

```bash
npm install repomix
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Process current directory with custom options
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

### Process Remote Repository

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Clone and process a GitHub repo
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

### Using Core Components

If you need more control, you can use the low-level APIs:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Find and collect files
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* config */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* config */ });
  
  // Count tokens
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Return analysis results
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```
