# Repomix Explorer Skill (Agent Skills)

Repomix provides a ready-to-use **Repomix Explorer** skill that enables AI coding assistants to analyze and explore codebases using Repomix CLI.

This skill is designed for Claude Code and other AI assistants that support the Agent Skills format.

## Quick Install

For Claude Code, install the official Repomix Explorer plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add yamadashy/repomix
/plugin install repomix-explorer@repomix
```

The Claude Code plugin provides namespaced commands such as `/repomix-explorer:explore-local` and `/repomix-explorer:explore-remote`. See [Claude Code Plugins](/guide/claude-code-plugins) for the full plugin setup.

For Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, and other Agent Skills-compatible assistants, install the standalone skill with the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add yamadashy/repomix --skill repomix-explorer
```

To target a specific assistant, pass `--agent`:

```bash
npx skills add yamadashy/repomix --skill repomix-explorer --agent codex
npx skills add yamadashy/repomix --skill repomix-explorer --agent openclaw
```

The Skills CLI installs the skill into the selected assistant's skills directory, such as `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `skills/` for OpenClaw projects.

For Hermes Agent, install the single-file skill with Hermes Agent's native skills command:

```bash
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamadashy/repomix/main/skills/repomix-explorer/SKILL.md
```

If you use Hermes Agent primarily for repository analysis, the [MCP Server](/guide/mcp-server) setup is also a good option because it runs Repomix directly as an MCP server.

## What It Does

Once installed, you can analyze codebases with natural language instructions.

#### Analyze remote repositories

```text
"What's the structure of this repo?
https://github.com/facebook/react"
```

#### Explore local codebases

```text
"What's in this project?
~/projects/my-app"
```

This is useful not only for understanding codebases, but also when you want to implement features by referencing your other repositories.

## How It Works

The Repomix Explorer skill guides AI assistants through the complete workflow:

1. **Run repomix commands** - Pack repositories into AI-friendly format
2. **Analyze output files** - Use pattern search (grep) to find relevant code
3. **Provide insights** - Report structure, metrics, and actionable recommendations

## Example Use Cases

### Understanding a New Codebase

```text
"I want to understand the architecture of this project.
https://github.com/vercel/next.js"
```

The AI will run repomix, analyze the output, and provide a structured overview of the codebase.

### Finding Specific Patterns

```text
"Find all authentication-related code in this repository."
```

The AI will search for auth patterns, categorize findings by file, and explain how authentication is implemented.

### Referencing Your Own Projects

```text
"I want to implement a similar feature to what I did in my other project.
~/projects/my-other-app"
```

The AI will analyze your other repository and help you reference your own implementations.

## Skill Contents

The skill includes:

- **User intent recognition** - Understands various ways users ask for codebase analysis
- **Repomix command guidance** - Knows which options to use (`--compress`, `--include`, etc.)
- **Analysis workflow** - Structured approach to exploring packed output
- **Best practices** - Efficiency tips like using grep before reading entire files
