# Using Repomix with GitHub Actions

You can automate the process of packing your codebase for AI analysis by integrating Repomix into your GitHub Actions workflows. This is useful for continuous integration (CI), code review, or preparing your repository for LLM-based tools.

## Basic Usage

Add the following step to your workflow YAML to pack your repository:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## Using Different Output Formats

You can specify different output formats using the `style` parameter (the default is `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## Packing Multiple Directories with Compression

You can specify multiple directories, include/exclude patterns, and enable smart compression:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true
```

## Uploading the Output as an Artifact

To make the packed file available for later workflow steps or for download, upload it as an artifact:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.xml
```

## Example: Full Workflow

Here is a complete example of a GitHub Actions workflow using Repomix:

```yaml
name: Pack repository with Repomix

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  pack-repo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Pack repository with Repomix
        uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
        with:
          output: repomix-output.xml

      - name: Upload Repomix output
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: repomix-output.xml
          path: repomix-output.xml
          retention-days: 30
```
