## Code Style

- Use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting
- Dependency injection for testability
- Keep files under 250 lines
- Add tests for new features

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Please make sure your code follows the style guide by running:

```bash

```

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure:

1. Your code passes all tests: Run `npm run test`
2. Your code adheres to our linting standards: Run `npm run lint`
3. You have updated relevant documentation
4. You follow the existing code style

## Website Development

The Repomix website is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). To run the website locally:

When updating documentation, you only need to update the English version first. The maintainers will handle translations to other languages.

## Release Process

For maintainers and contributors interested in the release process:
