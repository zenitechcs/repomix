Repomix is a tool that packs your entire repository into a single, AI-friendly file. It's designed to help you feed your codebase to Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Gemma, Llama, and more.

## Quick Start

Run this command in your project directory:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

That's it! You'll find a `repomix-output.xml` file containing your entire repository in an AI-friendly format.

You can then send this file to an AI assistant with a prompt like:

```
This file contains all the files in the repository combined into one.
I want to refactor the code, so please review it first.
```

The AI will analyze your entire codebase and provide comprehensive insights:

When discussing specific changes, the AI can help generate code. With features like Claude's Artifacts, you can even receive multiple interdependent files:

Happy coding! 🚀
